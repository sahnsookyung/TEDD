Reinforcement learning environment for inverse drug design.

## Set-up

Install dependencies:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
Activate environment:
```
conda activate mol-env
```

## Getting started
To get a working gym environment all that's needed is to use the provided repository structure 
(see [here](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/docs/creating-environments.md)):

* Dependencies that the environment needs have been defined in `setup.py`. 
* The environment's entry point has been defined in `gym_molecule/__init__.py`
* The environment has been imported into `gym_molecule/envs/__init.py__`
* With this structure the environment can be installed with `pip install -e .`
from the working directory.
* The environment definition is written in `gym_molecule/envs/molecule_env`,
and implements the interface provided by the `gym.Env` class (see 
the definition [here](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/core.py)).
* The essential methods defined are `step, reset, render, seed,`
and `close`.

## Installation
* Install anaconda python and pip. 
* Clone the repository from Gitlab/Github.
* Navigate into the cloned repository (directory)
* Run
 ```conda env create -f environment.yml```
* Run ```conda activate mol-env```
* Run ```pip install -e .```
* Run ```conda install -c schrodinger pymol-bundle```

The above was tested on a Windows 10 machine. The render method seemed to break on a VM running Ubuntu, and we didn't get to test the above instructions on a fully fledged Linux machine.

## Documentation Generation
This assumes you have the anaconda environment set-up, and will generate documentation using Sphinx.

* Make sure the anaconda environment mol-env is active. In Windows, run Anaconda prompt and run the command: ```conda activate mol-env``` in the project directory.
* Create a docs directory in the project base directory.
* Run ```sphinx-quickstart``` in the terminal/anaconda prompt. This will do some basic setup of the Sphinx documentation program and create some files, which include `conf.py` and `index.rst`. You will need to modify these files.
* In the file `conf.py`, uncomment and change the lines 
```
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))
``` 

to

``` 
import os\\
import sys\\
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../..'))
```
* Modify the ```extensions``` array in the `conf.py` file to ```extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc', 'sphinx.ext.coverage', 'sphinx.ext.napoleon'].```

* Add the line 
```
.. automodule:: gym_molecule.envs.molecule_env 
    :members: 
```
to the index.rst file.
* Run ```make html```. The documentation will be found in `docs/build/html`, and can be viewed in `index.html`.

## Testing
Pytest was used to test the environment, the user can run the tests from the project root directory.
